The idea of writing something like LingoSerb came to me when I found out that there is few resources which can provide most used Serbian words and use context. Moreover, online translators tend to provide inaccurate information.

One day I tried ChatGPT to get some most used Serbian words and translations, and it did it greate. It provided good use context as well. I thought that this source of language content can be packed in more handy box, something like LingoSerb.

Now LingoSerb provides flashcards for memorization and uses spaced repetition system. Also, it can help with use context of a word. It's quite important when It comes to language learning.

At the moment I'm working on improving content generation accuracy and content filtering system - there is a lot to do.
